						Manikhwe School is a foundation\programme that is dedicated 
						to teaching programming practical problem solving skills 
						offline and online all over the world. The school started 
						in the year 2019 with a focus on Java and Python programming. 
						The co-founder of the school Mr Lwandile Ganyile started it 
						with the purpose of practically teaching programming to high 
						school kids doing grade 8 and 9. However at that time he did 
						not have enough resources for kids, including but not limited 
						to food, transportation, laptops etc. As a result, the programme 
						for kids had to stop and Mr Ganyile focused on teaching grownups 
						online in order to get help rebuild the programme for kids.

						The very first problem had to do with food. Since lessons started at 
						09:00 am up to 17:00 pm, of cause kids had to consume something 
						during that period. Even though some brought their lunch we still 
						needed to provide them with our own food. They ate three times a day, 
						and we had to make sure they eat healthy food, the kind of food that 
						won’t make them fall asleep during sessions. The kind of food that 
						would rather energize them. Problem was, not every weekend the Manikhwe 
						School foundation/programme was able to provide enough food.

						Secondly, in regards to transportation. Because all sessions took place 
						on weekends, not all kids had parents that would bring them to school on 
						weekends using their own transport. Because of that, the Manikhwe School 
						foundation had to provide transport for everyone who might not have it. 
						The foundation did not possess company’s transportation then, and hence it 
						had to be rented. Roughly about 200 to 350 kids had to be picked from 
						different locations which was the main reason why transportation was expensive.

						Finally regarding laptops, on overage there were about 300 kids doing grade 8 
						and approximately 400 kids doing grade 9 on all schools Mr Ganyile went to. 
						With only about 50 laptops available for kids to use, young students did not 
						get the best out of the programme. Since the Manikhwe School is actual dedicated 
						to practical programming rather than theory, roughly about ten kids would 
						literally share one machine which was a huge negative impact of their learning 
						process. Because of the quantity of young students even more laptops were needed. 
						Approximately 600 laptops are needed in order for the programme to start over, 
						because each and every kid have to interact with his/her own machine during 
						programming sessions.

						It is the founder’s wish to continue the programme for kids and create a better 
						tomorrow by investing on young kids. Any help regarding the above mentioned 
						expenses would be appreciated.
